# MNIST-digital-recognition
A classification model for digits (0 to 9)

Dataset is downloaded from existing datasets present in keras. Therefore, the data is already clean, preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.
Total number of images of the digits: 70,000.
The 2 dimension images is initially converted into 1 dimensional array.

Using ANN:
Model is trained with neural network using tensorflow and keras. 
As the dataset is large enough, so less epochs also give good accuracy. Here, model is trained on 10 epochs.

Using CNN:
Conv2D and MaxPooling are used as convolution layers, then dense layer as fully connected layer is used.
